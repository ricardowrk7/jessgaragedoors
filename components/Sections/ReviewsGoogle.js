            I called on a Sunday evening and was Surprised They Picked Up. They Came Out First Thing Monday Morning and Repaired All My Garage Door Issues. Super Friendly, Very Professional,  Arrived When They Said They Would and Wasted No Time Getting Right to Work. I am Very Satisfied in the Quality of Work and the Price I Was Quoted. I Will Always Call Jess Garage Doors Inc. and I Highly Recommend Their Services.
            Thank You!!!   Sincerely,  John F.

            I canâ€™t say enough about the quick friendly knowledgeable service I received.  Not only was the price much more affordable but I was given the rational and reasoning for the repairs/replacement.  Same day assessment and full replacement.  I will call Jess Garage Door for every overhead door need I have in the future! Thank you!

            We could not be happier with Jess Overhead Garage Doors. Jessie & Mike are wonderful - we're very pleased with their workmanship and customer service. Also their costs were very reasonable and less than we anticipated. Thank you and we look forward to seeing you for our 3rd door, the first two look amazing!

            Highly recommend!  Super friendly and great quality work!  They came out same day too.  A friend referred me to Jess Garage Doors and they quoted me a great price.  This was a job for a broken spring on a Wayne Dalton style spring setup so it was a conversion to the normal spring on the outside of the bar instead of internal.  I initially had Precision Door out for a quote over the weekend (because they "don't charge extra for weekends") and had quote shock and that's why I was looking elsewhere.  Precision door was about 3x (this is why PD doesn't charge extra, they don't need to!) as much as Jess.  I could not be happier with Jess Garage Doors!

            Great response time, excellent job, friendly service, looks great and was reasonably priced.  I was told by other companies that it couldn't be done.  Guess they haven't met Jess and his crew.

            Showed up the same day and the garage door was fixed in about an hour. Fast, friendly, and affordable.

            I called about a broken garage door spring. Jess's  service man came to my place within a couple hours of my call and in another 2 hours had my garage door up and running. Very friendly and proficient to say the least..

            Great customer service! My garage door was broken and wouldn't close, they came out in the snow and repaired the door so I could close the door and keep the cold air from getting into the house.
