This was a job for a broken spring on a Wayne Dalton style spring setup so it was a conversion to the normal spring on the outside of the bar instead of internal.  I initially had Precision Door out for a quote over the weekend (because they "don't charge extra for weekends") and had quote shock and that's why I was looking elsewhere.  Precision door was about 3x (this is why PD doesn't charge extra, they don't need to!) as much as Jess.  I could not be happier with Jess Garage Doors!`,
